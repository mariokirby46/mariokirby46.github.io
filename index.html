<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h3><i>Hosted with GitHub Pages.</i></h3>
<p>
    For awhile now I've know that it is possible to just host a website off of Github directly, and I've also wanted to have a little website for myself, as a sort of mini journal.<br>
    As such, that starts today with this landing page :D
</p>
<p>I think as a list of things to do, I want to:
    <ul>
        <li>Write journal entries, like a little blog</li>
        <li>Turn this into a React app, just so I can flex my coding skills a little. (Credit to <a href="https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages">this repo</a> showing me its possible)</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    I'm writing this in plain HTML for now, and I've realised that:
    <ol type="A">
       <li>I need to break lines myself XD</li>
       <li>It's quite a hassle to insert tab indents in paragraphs, not that I've put any yet, but I'm sure I will in the future.</li>
       <li>Using new paragraphs and breaklines leads to different formatting, obviously cause I haven't used any CSS styling, but just with the default HTML.</li>
    </ol>
    But that's all for now, see yall!
